This Project was about learning some new libraries to expand my knowledge in the Front-End world. So I started to learn gatsby and d3. To make things interesting I did visualize KML-Data of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Rambalac" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">youtuber(Rambalac)</a>. The idea came to me while I was watching his videos. I kinda missed the live tracking of his walking route, after a little research I didn't find a website, so created this projects for myself.</p>

## <div name="design"> üî± Design </div>

<p> The Design is about understanding the fundamentals and appling them. In the process of creating the project, i created a japanese themed website. The colours are picked in awareness of the culture and regions to build a warm and asian like reputation of Yplore. A fluid UI rounds everything up.</p>
